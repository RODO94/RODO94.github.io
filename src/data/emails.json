    "emailBody": "Dear Councillor Nicholson,\n\nI am a Hackney resident writing to express huge concern for the health and safety of Hackney Council tenants Lisa, Mariama, and Max.\n\nLisa, Mariama and Max have been tenants of the Hackney Council for years. They have experienced a series of serious disrepair issues, including severe damp and mould. This has had proven impacts on their health, and that of the children of Lisa and Mariama.\n\nLisa, Mariama and Max have raised these concerns with Hackney Council over the years, but there has been no appropriate action. \n\nThe London Renters Union has requested that you meet them in order to discuss this situation for months. You have failed to respond. \n\nAs a resident in Hackney, I am deeply concerned that the council is ignoring its tenants and constituents. The Hackney Labour Party’s attitude to residents in the borough shows a lack of concern for our living conditions and health. The Labour Party cannot take our votes for granted when Labour councillors repeatedly fail to treat our fellow Hackney residents with the dignity and care that we all deserve. \n\nIt is particularly damning that this is happening just as Awaab’s Law has come into force. Awaab’s law states that social landlords have an absolute obligation to deal with serious health hazards in their tenants' homes. The solution to the issues should take the tenant’s health into account. If the issues can’t be resolved, the landlord should offer alternative accommodation. \n\nWe demand that you urgently meet the London Renters Unions in order to discuss the situations of Lisa, Mariama, and Max, and that you take action to ensure that they and their families have the safe home that all residents need.\n\nKind regards,\n {{username}}",
